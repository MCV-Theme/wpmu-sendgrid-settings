SendGrid settings for WordPress Multisite

## Description

## Installation

### Manual

Check out the Codex for more information about [installing plugins manually](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

1. Download the latest [tagged archive](https://github.com/MCV-Theme/wpmu-sendgrid-settings/releases) (choose the "zip" option).
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Fix the folder name to remove the extra stuff GitHub adds, like _-master_. Rename to **wpmu-sendgrid-settings**.
4. Copy the folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
5. Set plugin to activate automatically when new subsite is created. Use **Multisite Plugin Manager** by Aaron Edwards.
